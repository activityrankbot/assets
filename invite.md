## Permissions

> [!CAUTION]
> Bots with the Read Messages permission may abuse it by reading the content of users' messages.
ActivityRank prevents this by opting out of the `MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent and therefore
has no access to the content or any attachments to user messages, unless mentioned in that message.
